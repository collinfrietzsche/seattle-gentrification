## Project Description


##### Background of Data Set
This data comes from Seattleâ€™s Open Data website. We are focusing on data from urban design and pricing in order to provide our users with information regarding the housing prices in Seattle. 

#### Audiences for this project
Our main audience for this project is people looking to move in the Seattle area. This data allows our audience to view the housing prices of specified neighborhoods and explore other factors within the neighboorhood they are interested in. We are framing our project around this audience, hoping to provide insight regarding the housing prices in Seattle neighborhoods. 

##### Questions that will be investigated
1. How have housing prices in Seattle changed over time?
2. What are the factors that influence housing prices?
3. What are the city features in each neighborhood?
4. What are the average housing prices in each neighborhood?


## Technical Description
__Format of Project:__ Shiny.io 
__Format of Data Read in:__ .csv files
__Major Libraries Used:__ Plotly, dplyr, ggplot2, knitr, shiny, shinythemes    

#### Data Wrangling Needed
Most of the data wrangling for this project will be to clean up bad data entries, join tables on geolocation, and group by regions (municipalities).

#### Questions to be Answered with Statistical Analysis:
1. What regions have the highest housing cost?
2. Can we predict housing prices based on the factors we chose to analyze?
3. What factors dictate price?

#### Anticipated Major Challenges
1. There is a lot of data that needs to be aggregated. Some of it may be useful, but a lot (we will most likely find) will not.
2. Identifying key factors and trends that influence housing prices in Seattle 
3. Working with Shiny.io

#### Future Questions to Investigate
1. Can we build a better model?
2. What other features can we investigate that influence housing prices?
