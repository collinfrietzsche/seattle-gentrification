# seattle-gentrification
# Info201 Group Project


## Project Description


##### Background of Data Set
This data comes from Seattle’s Open Data website. We are focusing on data from transportation, urban design, and pricing in order to identify and quantity factors that impact gentrification and the causes it has on factors like housing prices.

#### Audiences for this project
Our main audience for this project is people looking to move in the Seattle area. This data allows our audience to move into growing communities, areas with high transportation access, and within their budgets.

##### Questions that will be investigated
1. How does access to public space impact housing prices and land use?
2. What dictates better “urban design”?
3. Does “better” design make spaces safer?



## Technical Description
__Format of Project:__ Shiny.io 
__Format of Data Read in:__ .csv files
__Major Libraries Used:__ Plotly, dplyr, ggplot2, knitr, shiny, shinythemes    

#### Data Wrangling Needed
Most of the data wrangling for this project will be to clean up bad data entries, join tables on geolocation, and group by regions (municipalities).

#### Questions to be Answered with Statistical Analysis:
1. What regions have the highest housing cost?
2. What regions have the greatest access to transportation?
3. What regions are ADA accessible?
4. What areas score highest in “urban planning”
5. Can we predict housing prices based on the factors we chose to analyze?
6. Does one factor dictate price more than any other?

#### Anticipated Major Challenges
1. There is a lot of data that needs to be aggregated. Some of it may be useful, but a lot (we will most likely find) will not.
2. Identifying key factors that influence urban design, house prices, gentrification
3. Working with Shiny.io

#### Future Questions to Investigate
1. Can we build a better model?
